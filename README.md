# **BCCA Procurement Team Budget Tracker**



### **Motivation/Description:**
  
  The motivation behind this project is to create a budget tracker for the procurement team at Base Camp Coding Academy. The idea is that we will make a software that will allow a user to create a budget based on whether or not the user is in Classic or in Graduate program, it will also allow the user to input how many people you will be purchasing for, 


--------------------------------------------

### **Core User Workflow:**
- First time user uses program it should prompt the user to input the date, number of people, and per diem amount.
- It should allow the user to input the date and the expense.
- It should track what dates fall in which month/week and allow the user to print a report of all the expenses.
- It should track the amount of money available based on previous expenses and added weekly per diem.
--------------------------------------------

### **Basic Goals:**
- Print date on program onset.
- Track Available Money
- Add Expenses
- Add/Edit Student Amount/Per Diem
- Print a report to the console and to a text file.

### **Advanced Goals:**
- Overall Gains/Losses tracked over time period.
- Have it change the cohort after a year.
- Print report by month/week (do both?)

### **Lofty Goals:**
- Allow the user to choose between Classic and Graduate program
- Date Tracking (for Inputs)
- Graph Tracker of Gains/Losses
- Track how much spent at each location by month

**Daily Goals:**
